# Cosmology Integration and CMB Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for calculating and analyzing cosmological parameters, with a focus on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) computations and integration methods for cosmological observables.

## Overview of Files

1. **`CMB.py`**: This script handles CMB-related calculations, likely involving cosmological parameters, power spectra, or other CMB observables.
2. **`CAMBCheck.py`**: A script intended for verifying results or performing consistency checks on CMB calculations, potentially using the CAMB (Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background) Python library.
3. **`CosmoIntegrator.py`**: This script performs integration of cosmological functions or parameters, useful for deriving observable quantities based on cosmological models.

Each script is modular and is intended for research purposes, including symbolic manipulation, numerical integration, and CMB power spectrum analysis.

## Requirements

Ensure that the following packages are installed:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `scipy`: For scientific computing and integration
- `matplotlib`: For plotting (optional, if visualization is needed)
- `camb`: For CMB power spectrum calculations (if using CAMB functions)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib camb
